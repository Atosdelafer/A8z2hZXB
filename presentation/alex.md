# Terms


* building blocks of facts, rules, and queries.


* 4 kinds of terms:


* atoms


* numbers (both are called constants)


* variables


* complex terms


---


# Atom


Either:


* string of charachrers..


* arbitraty string of ch. in " "


* string of special characters


---


# Numbers


* Floats


* Integers


* Straigtforward syntax


---


# Variable


* starts with upper-case letter or _


* anonimous variable _ 


---


# Complex term


* building block: functor


* nested functors make up complex terms 


---

# Examples



---

# Clauses

* Rules (clauses) state information that is conditionally true of the situation of interest.
* term1 :- term2
* term1 is true if term2 is true.

# Unification (how it works)





Two terms unify if they are the same term or if they contain variables that can be uniformly instantiated with terms in such a way that the resulting terms are equal.


___


# what this means??





...examples


___


# more on unification..


* two terms either unify or not


* if they unify, we are interested to know how the variables have to be instantiated to make the terms unify.


___


# more precise rules:


Two terms (term1 and term2) unify:


* If they are both constants, they unify iff they are the same atom (or number)


* If term1 is a variable and term2 is any term, then they unify and term1 is instantiated to term2.


* If both terms are variables, theyâ€™re both instantiated to each other.


* If both are complex terms and ... (next silde)


* Iff it follows from the rules above that they unify.

If term1 and term2 are complex terms, they unify iff:


* they have the same functor and arity (nr. of args)


* all their corr. args unify


* the variable instantiations are compatible

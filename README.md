# Prolog Embedding in C#

This repository contains the results of our attempt to embed Prolog in C#, a general-purpose logic programming language.
It is considered as one of the first and most popular logic programming language available.
Originally Prolog was intended as a way to process natural language, but it has also been used for theorem proving and expert systems.

The language is suited for situations in which rule-based logical queries are used, for example databases or voice processing systems.
It originated from first-order logic and is, unlike most programming languages, declarative.
This means that the flow is expressed in terms of relation represented as fact and rules.
By running a query over these relations, a computation can be done.
